## How to Translate
Follow this guide and you will be translating LewdBot in no time.
<br/>
1) Head to [LewdBot Wiki](https://github.com/Fabricio20/LewdWiki) and see if your desired language already is translated.
2) Fork the Repo
3) On your repo, create a new `LangName.properties` file
4) Now translate it by copying the default file `English.properties` and changing the values after the `=`.
5) Once you are done, commit the changes and push to GitHub.
6) After that, head over to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Fabricio20/LewdWiki/pulls)
7) Click on `New Pull Request`
8) Click on `Compare Across Forks`
9) On `Head Fork` select `YourName/LewdWiki`
10) Click the `Create Pull Request` button
<br/>
After that, you wait until I merge it to LewdBot's repo, and your translation will be available in the next restart.

**PS**: Translator role will be given to those who translate a considerable portion of a language (If you want it, make sure to either mention your discord name#discrim on the PR or have the GitHub username be the same of your discord username).
