### How do I set up music?
**A**: Check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgkwzCbG-A4) youtube video. (Also read three questions below if you have any issues with music).

---
### Why won't the bot reply?
**A**: First, make sure you are using the right prefix, by default, the right prefix is `@LewdBot`, you can change it with `@LewdBot prefix !` (to change it to ! for example). Second, check if she has perms to speak and read messages on the channel you are using the commands in and third, make sure she's online (Sometimes a shard dies and can't recover, making her appear offline for some servers), in this case, please poke me.

### Why does the music lag/shutter/skips sometimes/when starting?
**A**: Most of the times, this happens because there is too many people using the bot, and my small vps can't handle it, I'm working on getting a new one, but for that I need money (If you want to contribute, you can donate with [Paypal](http://short.notfab.net/donate) or monthly with [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Fabricio20)).

### Why won't music commands work?
**A**: First, make sure the Module is enabled (`@LewdBot modules Music`), then, make sure you are using the right command (It's `lm` not `im`).

---
### How can I change the prefix?

### What is a prefix?
